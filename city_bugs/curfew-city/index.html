Trafic is abscent. You get to experience urbanist dream albeit ephemeral.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the cycling lane on one of the most crowded bridges during regular time:</p> <p><img src="/assets/bridge-during-curfew.png" alt="" /></p> <p>You get the same for the roads.</p> <p>For certain period of time, several bridges across the Dnipro river were also closed for the cars. Only pedestrians and cyclists were allowed. As a result, riding on them was extremely satisfying as you could use all the lanes and it was very quiet.</p> <p>I semi-jokingly said that it would be good to leave those bridges closed for the cars even after the war ends. Especially, since some of them are in a questionable conditions. However, most of my friends already bought into the car-centric city drama and have their own cars, so naturally they didn&#39;t support this idea.</p> <p>Cycling in Kyiv is still more of a leisure than a means of transportation.</p> <p>Several light-weight bridges designed specifically for pedestrians and cyclists would give you decent means for crossing the river and provide induced demand. Also they must be way cheaper to build than regular bridges, since they don&#39;t need to handle as much weight.</p> <code>&#91;in progress...&#93;</code> <div class=page-foot > Anton Smirnov. <br/> If we reduce the noise, we can hear our surroundings better. <br/> Contacts: <a href="mailto:tonysmn97@gmail.com">tonysmn97@gmail.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pxl-th">github</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pxl_th/">instagram</a> </div> </div>
